## ListView and ListModel 🧑🏻‍💻

ListView uses the Model-View-Controller structure to visualize our data. 🎦

In this example, I've created a simple example using ListView. We have a table displaying the name and cost of fruits. 🍇

Roles provide easy access to data. In this example, I've defined the cost and name as roles 🌻
