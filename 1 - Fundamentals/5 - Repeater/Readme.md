## Repeater 🐦‍🔥

You can list your data using a Repeater. If a dynamic model isn't necessary, you can use a Repeater. However, if the data you're using is large, it's recommended to use a ListView 🧑🏻‍💻

In this example, there's a table displaying your name and age. ℹ️

After defining the model, I used a Repeater to visualize the data. 🛜
