## Dynamic Models 🚥

You can use a Dynamic Model in ListView 🧑🏻‍💻

In this example, I'm using a ListModel to encapsulate data. ListModel inherits from QAbstractListModel. This means you can use methods like add, remove, clear, set, etc. 🔘

I have a list with a first and last name 🧑🏻‍🦰

"Add" Button: Adds a person to the end of the list 💚

"Remove" Button: Removes the person from the end of the list ❤️

"Clear" Button: Clears the entire list 💛

"Remove Next" Button: Removes the indexed person from the list 🔘

"Edit" Button: Replaces the indexed person's name with another name 🧑
