Hello 🌼

In this project, I created sample applications using QML in the Qt Creator environment, focusing on Model View Controllers. 🎉

I used the following Udemy courses as a basis: **Qt6 QML For Beginners: The Fundamentals/Daniel Gakwaya** 🎦

You can see the contents of each sample application by looking at the Readme files. 🌈

Good work 🤗
