You can use Dynamic Model in the ListView 🧑🏻‍💻

In this example, I use ListModel to encapsulate the datas. ListModel inherits from QAbstractListModel. So, you can use add, remove, clear, set etc. Methods 🔘

There is a list included name and surname 🧑🏻‍🦰

“Ekle” Button: Adds a person to end of the list

“Çıkar” Button: Removes the person from end of the list

“Temizle” Button: Clears the all list

“Sıradakini Çıkar” Button: : Removes the 1. İndex person from the list

“Editle” Button: Sets the 1.index person name to another name
